# Wireless_simulation_labs
Labs using VMs to simulate a variety of wireless concepts when access to hardware is not possible.

The lab called "Virtual_WLAN_testing_AP_Client_monitor_WLAN_walkthrough_(lab2).odt" is the best one to start with right now
The other was started first but needs some reworking to correct a few conceptual errors
the lab to implement EAPOL still needs a lot of work to just get functional
